# Los Angeles Fire Department Analytics Report and AB Testing
The purpose of this project is two-fold.  First is to explore the data with the intent to a question that can be answered with an experiment.  Second is to create a research proposal to answer the first part.  I explored a dataset put out by the Los Angeles Fire Department which includes information on all incidents they responded to.  The type of information included type of emergency, units dispatched, time the incident was received and time the units were dispatched.  

While exploring the data, I found that for the most part, the department's turnout time (the time a station is alerted to the time the responders are driving towards the scene) is at or under the suggested time of 60 seconds.  However, their turnout time increases up to 70 seconds at two specific points in time.  The research proposal aims to reduce the turnout time to under 60 seconds throughout the whole shift by introducing a roll out plan and identifying primary and secondary metrics to evaluate if the plan is successful or not.
