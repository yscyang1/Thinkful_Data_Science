# Citi Bike Share Analytics Report 
This capstone project is my first project during in the Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp curriculum.  The purpose of this project is to ask and answer analytical questions on a dataset of our choosing.  In this case, I chose to analyze Citi Bike's dataset in New York City.

### Project Description
Bike sharing systems are often seen in large cities where bicycles are available for a fee.  Citi Bike is one such company, with a location in New York City.  They have generously provided data regarding trip information and anonymized rider information.  In the interest of helping Citi Bike increase revenue, I wanted to explore two parts of the data: 

1.  **Time**
    1.  What time of year has more riders?
    2.  When is the most popular time to rent a bike?
2.  **Location**
    1.  Can we identify hotspots?
    2.  Can we prevent bikes from being stolen?
