    "### 1 - The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

    "### 2 - In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future.\n",

    "It sounds like Jar Jar and Windu went to 8 different planets (so a total of 16 planets).  We don't know the population of the planets, whether they talked to only leaders or the general population, if there were more males or females they talked to, etc.  Perhaps Jar Jar and Windu should have been sent to the same planets but different areas (at the same time).  In addition, we should see the breakdown of attitudes based on friendly vs unfriendly planets for each representative.  Its possible that one of them converted more people with a certain type of planet (ex:  Windu was converted more people on unfriendly planets than Jar Jar).  In that case, the Jedi should consider sending that representative to the type of planet they had better results in.  "
