    "The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

The drones should be split evenly (by planet friendliness) into 2 groups of 50 droids each.  In one group, the original slogan should be given to the droids whereas the second group should receive the new slogan.  Both slogans should be delivered by one person of leadership, such as Emperor Palpatine.\n",

If the recruitment rates are similar, then compare the rates to the new slogan.  If the slogan has increased recruitment, we can conclude that the new slogan is better.  Else find a new solution or a new slogan.\n",
