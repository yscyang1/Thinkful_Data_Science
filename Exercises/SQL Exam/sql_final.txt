-- 1.  Write a query that allows you to inspect the schema of the naep table.
SELECT
	*
FROM
	information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE
	TABLE_NAME = 'naep';

-- 2.  Write a query that returns the first 50 records of the naep table.
SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	naep
LIMIT 50;


-- 3.  Write a query that returns summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state. Make sure to sort the results alphabetically by state name.
SELECT 
	COUNT(state) as  count,
	AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS average,
	MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS minimum,
	MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS maximum,
	state
FROM 
	naep
GROUP BY state
ORDER BY state ASC;


-- 4.  Write a query that alters the previous query so that it returns only the summary statistics for avg_math_4_score by state with differences in max and min values that are greater than 30.
WITH
	stats
AS (
	SELECT
		COUNT(state) as  num_state,
		AVG(avg_math_4_score) AS average,
		MIN(avg_math_4_score) AS minimum,
		MAX(avg_math_4_score) AS maxinum,
		state
	FROM
		naep
	GROUP BY state
	ORDER BY state ASC
	)
	
SELECT
	*
FROM 
	stats s
WHERE
	s.maxinum - s.minimum > 30;


-- 5.  Write a query that returns a field called bottom_10_states that lists the states in the bottom 10 for avg_math_4_score in the year 2000.
SELECT
	state as bottom_10_states
FROM 
	naep
WHERE
	year = 2000
ORDER BY avg_math_4_score ASC
LIMIT 10;


-- 6.  Write a query that calculates the average avg_math_4_score rounded to the nearest 2 decimal places over all states in the year 2000.
SELECT
	ROUND(AVG(avg_math_4_score),2)
FROM 
	naep
WHERE
	year = 2000;


-- 7.  Write a query that returns a field called below_average_states_y2000 that lists all states with an avg_math_4_score less than the average over all states in the year 2000.
WITH 
	stats
AS (
	SELECT 
		AVG(avg_math_4_score) as avg_score
	FROM
		naep
	WHERE 
		year = 2000
	)
SELECT
	state as below_average_states_y2000
FROM
	naep, stats
WHERE
	year = 2000 AND
	avg_math_4_score < avg_score;


-- 8.  Write a query that returns a field called scores_missing_y2000 that lists any states with missing values in the avg_math_4_score column of the naep data table for the year 2000.
SELECT 
	state as scores_missing_y2000
FROM 
	naep
WHERE 
	avg_math_4_score IS NULL AND
	year = 2000;


-- 9.  Write a query that returns for the year 2000 the state, avg_math_4_score, and total_expenditure from the naep table left outer joined with the finance table, using id as the key and ordered by total_expenditure greatest to least. Be sure to round avg_math_4_score to the nearest 2 decimal places, and then filter out NULL avg_math_4_scores in order to see any correlation more clearly.
SELECT 
	n.state, ROUND(n.avg_math_4_score,2) AS avg_math_4_score, f.total_expenditure
FROM
	naep n
LEFT JOIN 
	finance f
ON 
	n.id = f.id
WHERE 
	n.year = 2000 AND
	n.avg_math_4_score IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
	f.total_expenditure DESC
