    "Predicting running times tells me that this is a regression problem. Choosing the best method really depends on the size of the data, but the first methods that come to mind are OLS, random forest/decision tree, and KNN.  If the data is strictly from the Olympics (e.g. names, location, running times for each race), then any of these methods would work.  However, if extraneous information were used, such as weather data, KNN might take too long and should be removed from the list of possible methods.  "
